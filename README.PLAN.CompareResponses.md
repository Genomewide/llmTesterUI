# üéØ Response Comparison Feature Plan

## üìã **Project Overview**

Add comprehensive response comparison functionality to the LLM Tester UI, allowing users to select multiple interactions and compare their responses side-by-side. This will enable users to analyze differences between model responses, system prompts, and performance metrics.

## üéØ **Feature Requirements**

### **Core Functionality**
- Multi-select interactions from project history
- Side-by-side comparison view of selected responses
- Diff highlighting for text differences
- Comparison of metadata (response time, model info, etc.)
- Export comparison results
- Filter and search within comparison view

### **Comparison Types**
- **Response Content**: Text differences, structure analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, token usage
- **Model Behavior**: Different models on same input
- **Prompt Variations**: Same model with different system prompts
- **Structured Output**: JSON/XML/YAML comparison

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Component Structure**
